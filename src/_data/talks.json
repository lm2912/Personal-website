    "description": "In 2020, I built my first side project. I 'scratched my own itch' and started selling it, and since then, the project has earned me over $15,000. However, just a few months after its release, I was so overwhelmed by maintenance work that I considered shutting it down. Instead of killing the goose that lays (small) golden eggs, I decided to automate the project.",
